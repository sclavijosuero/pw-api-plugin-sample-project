# pw-api-plugin-sample-project
This project offers examples of how to use the pw-api-plugin in your Playwright setup to simplify and enhance API testing. It also provides detailed guidance on converting a standard Playwright project, which uses Playwright's standard API testing methods or Axios methods, into one that leverages the pw-api-plugin.
